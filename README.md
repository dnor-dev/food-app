This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## APP FEATURES

This is a basic CRUD full stack app (MERN), it is built on typescript, next, redux, paypal and material ui.
The backend is built using the next js feature which allows us to build api's within our app.

## WORKFLOW

The Workflow of the app is very simple in terms of use. The products are loaded on the homepage and each products when clicked takes the user to another page where they see the full details of the product and can add it to the cart then make orders via cash or a paypal acct.
All the products and orders are handled by the admin(/admin).
